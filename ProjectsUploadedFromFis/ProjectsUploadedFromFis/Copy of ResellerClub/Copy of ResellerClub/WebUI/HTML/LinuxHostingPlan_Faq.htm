                                        Q. What is Shared Web hosting?

                                        In Shared Web Hosting, multiple clients are hosted on a single server i.e. the clients
                                        share the server's resources. This helps reduce the cost, since the cost of the
                                        server and its resources are spread over all the clients/packages hosted on the
                                        server. Shared Hosting is perfect for personal websites, small and mid-sized businesses
                                        that do not require all the resources of a server.
