        Q. I own a website with another host - can I move my site on to website builder?
    </div>
    <div class="ans">
        No, I'm afraid you will not be able to migrate an existing Website directly on to
        a Website Builder package. However, you can move website files over by downloading
        them from your other host then uploading them to your website builder account. The
        website content can then be filled to achieve a similar result.
