        Q. What is SSL and what is an SSL Certificate?</div>
    <div class="ans">
        <p>
            SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the standard security technology for setting up an
            encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures the privacy
            of all data passed between the web server and browsers.</p>
        <p>
            An SSL certificate enables a web server to create an SSL connection. SSL certificates
            are expected by consumers for any site that handles sensitive information like identity
            information, credit card numbers, or confidential records.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="que">
        Q. Why do I need an SSL Certificate?</div>
    <div class="ans">
        <p>
            If your website requires users to log in, enter personal information such as credit
            card numbers or view confidential information such as financial statements, you
            need to keep the data private and assure your Customers that their data is completely
            safe.</p>
        Use of an SSL digital certificate assures website users of 3 things:
        <ol>
            <li>1. That the website really is who it claims to be.</li>
            <li>2. That credit card numbers and other confidential information is encrypted (128bit
                or higher) and cannot be intercepted.</li>
            <li>3. That the data sent and received cannot be tampered with or forged.</li></ol>
    </div>
    <!-- <div class="que">Q. So, how does my Customer/user know that the website is safe?</div> -->
    <!-- <div class="ans"> -->
    <!-- There are 3 primary components that allow users to identify if your website is safe. Visually, they look as follows -->

        Q. Can I upgrade my SSL Certificate?</div>
    <div class="ans">
        <p>
            There is no provision of upgrading an SSL Certificate.</p>
        <p>
            However, if you require a more secure certificate for your website, you can purchase
            it and install it on the same web server as the old certificate.</p>

        Q. Do I need technical expertise to set up an SSL certificate on my web site?</div>
    <div class="ans">

        a series of simple steps. Detailed information about installing our SSL Certificates
