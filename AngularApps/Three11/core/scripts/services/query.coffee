# The query service is responsible for executing and monitoring HTTP requests
# to the server.
#
# When you want to execute a query, you inject the query service instance
# and pass in a 'query' object.
#
# To add a body, params and headers to the query object you call 'setBody(<object>)',
# 'appendParam(<key>, <value>)', and 'appendHeader(<key>, <value>)' respectively.
#
#   Eg: With the following 'JsonHomeDocument':
#           "category": {
#               "href": "/categories/{id}",
#               "hints": {
#                   "allow": ["GET", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE"],
#           }
#
#   If we want to create a query object to represent a 'PUT' request with id 123
#   we call 'replaceCategory(123)'. After the query object is created we can then
#   add the body, headers, and params to the query object before we run the query
#   using 'QueryService.sendQuery(query)', which will return a promise.
